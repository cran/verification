Version 1.29 -  Correct summary function of for multiple contingency tables.  Error reported by Ian Jollife.
	     permit multi.cont function to accept table as input and to accept vector for forecast probabilities.
	-  Change method for calculating area under curve.
	-  Require threshold intervals be provided for forecasts with more than 1000 unique predictions.
	- minor changes to attribute diagram to not fail with empty bins.
	- renamed output from multi.cont.
	
	
Version 1.26  Corrected incorrect use of \method plus error in attribute example.
Version 1.20

Correct skill score for continuous/ continuous  forecasts.

Added warning notes to attribute diagram.

Change ROC plot to return estimated values of area under the ROC
curve as illustrated by Simon Mason's example.

*****

Change log
Allowed rps to take a vector of single forecasts.  Corrected
    documentation.


Corrected FAR notation in mulit.cont.

Corrected plotting errors in roc.plot

Added lines.roc and lines.attrib to add lines to either roc or attribute diagrams.

Changed pop example data.

rps needs to be fixed.

Version 1.15 - 1.17
Added lineADD to add lines to reliability and attribute diagrams
using prob.bin objects from verify.

Added IS function submitted by B. Cassati

Returned int.scale functions since waveslim has been updated.

Version 1.14
Hopefully temporarily removed int.scale fucntion, documentation and
    data until the waveslim package is updated.

Enhanced discrimination plot function.  This allows marginal boxplots
to be displayed on the top plot.

Added precip.ensemble data - sample ensemble data of a precipitation forecast

Removed the zzz.R file to ensure that the file compiled with 2.5 version of R

Changed internal variables within the table.stat command from integers to numeric
to avoid overflow errors.

Added ChangeLog file
